# SortingVisualizer

A little GUI to visualize sorting algorithms. It is basically a remake of a program I wrote when I took a Datastructures and Algorithms class. Helped me to unterstand the algorithms better.

Only supports bubblesort right now, but I will include more soon.

Currently Supports
* BubbleSort
* more to come 

# How to Run

The easiest way to run it is to just clone it and run it in your IDE. Alternatively, use "python main.py" in your console should do the job (as long as you are in the correct direcoty etc.). Make sure you have the necessary packages installed, should only require PyQt5.
Choose a size for your array by using the slider, click the "generate" button to create and show a random array of that size and finally click on "animate" to get the visualizing going. Larger arrays will be sorted faster (fps wise)

# What did I learn?
* Creating a GUI using the Qt creator and PyQt5
* A refresher on sorting algorithms
* matplotlib and pyqt aren't friends ;)
